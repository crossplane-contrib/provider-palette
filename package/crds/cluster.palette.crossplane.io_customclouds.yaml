                            Key-value pairs to override specific values in the YAML. Supports template variables, wildcard patterns, field pattern search, document-specific and global overrides.

                            Template variables: Simple identifiers that replace ${var}, {{var}}, or $var patterns in YAML (e.g., 'cluster_name' replaces ${cluster_name})
                            Wildcard patterns: Patterns starting with '*' that match field names containing the specified substring (e.g., '*cluster-api-autoscaler-node-group-max-size' matches any field containing 'cluster-api-autoscaler-node-group-max-size')
                            Field pattern search: Patterns that find and update ALL matching nested fields anywhere in YAML (e.g., 'replicas' updates any 'replicas' field, 'rootVolume.size' updates any 'rootVolume.size' pattern)
                            Document-specific syntax: 'Kind.path' (e.g., 'Cluster.metadata.labels', 'AWSCluster.spec.region')
                            Global path syntax: 'path' (e.g., 'metadata.name', 'spec.region')

                            Processing order: 1) Template substitution, 2) Wildcard patterns, 3) Field pattern search, 4) Path-based overrides. Supports dot notation for nested paths and array indexing with [index]. Values are strings but support JSON syntax for arrays/objects.

                            Field pattern search: Patterns that find and update ALL matching nested fields anywhere in YAML (e.g., 'replicas' updates any 'replicas' field, 'rootVolume.size' updates any 'rootVolume.size' pattern)
                            Document-specific syntax: 'Kind.path' (e.g., 'AWSMachineTemplate.spec.template.spec.instanceType')
                            Global path syntax: 'path' (e.g., 'metadata.name', 'spec.instanceType')

                            Processing order: 1) Template substitution, 2) Wildcard patterns, 3) Field pattern search, 4) Path-based overrides. Supports dot notation for nested paths and array indexing with [index]. Values are strings but support JSON syntax for arrays/objects.

                            Key-value pairs to override specific values in the YAML. Supports template variables, wildcard patterns, field pattern search, document-specific and global overrides.

                            Template variables: Simple identifiers that replace ${var}, {{var}}, or $var patterns in YAML (e.g., 'cluster_name' replaces ${cluster_name})
                            Wildcard patterns: Patterns starting with '*' that match field names containing the specified substring (e.g., '*cluster-api-autoscaler-node-group-max-size' matches any field containing 'cluster-api-autoscaler-node-group-max-size')
                            Field pattern search: Patterns that find and update ALL matching nested fields anywhere in YAML (e.g., 'replicas' updates any 'replicas' field, 'rootVolume.size' updates any 'rootVolume.size' pattern)
                            Document-specific syntax: 'Kind.path' (e.g., 'Cluster.metadata.labels', 'AWSCluster.spec.region')
                            Global path syntax: 'path' (e.g., 'metadata.name', 'spec.region')

                            Processing order: 1) Template substitution, 2) Wildcard patterns, 3) Field pattern search, 4) Path-based overrides. Supports dot notation for nested paths and array indexing with [index]. Values are strings but support JSON syntax for arrays/objects.

                            Field pattern search: Patterns that find and update ALL matching nested fields anywhere in YAML (e.g., 'replicas' updates any 'replicas' field, 'rootVolume.size' updates any 'rootVolume.size' pattern)
                            Document-specific syntax: 'Kind.path' (e.g., 'AWSMachineTemplate.spec.template.spec.instanceType')
                            Global path syntax: 'path' (e.g., 'metadata.name', 'spec.instanceType')

                            Processing order: 1) Template substitution, 2) Wildcard patterns, 3) Field pattern search, 4) Path-based overrides. Supports dot notation for nested paths and array indexing with [index]. Values are strings but support JSON syntax for arrays/objects.

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                            Key-value pairs to override specific values in the YAML. Supports template variables, wildcard patterns, field pattern search, document-specific and global overrides.

                            Template variables: Simple identifiers that replace ${var}, {{var}}, or $var patterns in YAML (e.g., 'cluster_name' replaces ${cluster_name})
                            Wildcard patterns: Patterns starting with '*' that match field names containing the specified substring (e.g., '*cluster-api-autoscaler-node-group-max-size' matches any field containing 'cluster-api-autoscaler-node-group-max-size')
                            Field pattern search: Patterns that find and update ALL matching nested fields anywhere in YAML (e.g., 'replicas' updates any 'replicas' field, 'rootVolume.size' updates any 'rootVolume.size' pattern)
                            Document-specific syntax: 'Kind.path' (e.g., 'Cluster.metadata.labels', 'AWSCluster.spec.region')
                            Global path syntax: 'path' (e.g., 'metadata.name', 'spec.region')

                            Processing order: 1) Template substitution, 2) Wildcard patterns, 3) Field pattern search, 4) Path-based overrides. Supports dot notation for nested paths and array indexing with [index]. Values are strings but support JSON syntax for arrays/objects.

                            Template variables: Simple identifiers that replace ${var}, {{var}}, or $var patterns in YAML (e.g., 'node_count' replaces ${node_count})

                            Field pattern search: Patterns that find and update ALL matching nested fields anywhere in YAML (e.g., 'replicas' updates any 'replicas' field, 'rootVolume.size' updates any 'rootVolume.size' pattern)
                            Document-specific syntax: 'Kind.path' (e.g., 'AWSMachineTemplate.spec.template.spec.instanceType')
                            Global path syntax: 'path' (e.g., 'metadata.name', 'spec.instanceType')

                            Processing order: 1) Template substitution, 2) Wildcard patterns, 3) Field pattern search, 4) Path-based overrides. Supports dot notation for nested paths and array indexing with [index]. Values are strings but support JSON syntax for arrays/objects.
